                    <b class="firstLine">Cryptocurrencies</b> are some of the most controversial, yet engaging forms of payment for one to get interested in. However, there remains a looming sense of unprescedence amongst all these currencies, you are
                    given thousands to chose from however, without a baseline you are stranded in an ocean of them. Knowing which cryptocurrencies that stand out from the rest will help you differentiate from what is a scam, or what is a project centralized
                    around the next <b>stable coin!</b>
                    <br />
                    <b class="firstLine">Regardless</b> of the cryptocurrency that interests you, there are many different ways to use them. Some coins like Ethereum utilize the process of staking to help holders of this coin to gain some money from all
                    the transactions burned by others. Another form of this, can be replacing the stable currency of countries, an example of this can be USDT or XLM. Both of these are essientially their own stable currencies, however just like our most
                    powerful currency, the euro, there are still fluctuations that will occur. Knowing how you'll utilize the coins will help you with giving certain use cases to cryptocurrencies.
