                        <b class="firstLine">Traditional </b>investing is something that involves an individual with capital and their commitment to a company usually, however with cryptocurrencies, this differs is many ways. Unlike traditional investing,
                        since this is meant to be used as a currency, you'll have people constantly trading their coins. This will in turn influence the price of the coins and may cause inflation to occur if there is a high amount of coins in circulation
                        with not enough trading occuring. If there's no cap on the max circulation in supply, that is where inflation is mostly prominate.

                    <b class="firstLine">Treat </b>currencies as assets in this space, unlike regular currencies which are tied to shares and stakes in companies, cryptocurrencies are tied with a control in the network relative to the market value of
                    each coin. Although it may seem like cryptocurrencies are unique in their own right, you are essientially buying an asset, which can be very volitle at times, way more so than traditional currencies.
